# Industry Talk 1
##🎤PPG Industry Talk 

On 20th November 2025, I had the opportunity to attend my first industry talk at UTM, delivered by PPG,
a global company specialising in paints, coatings, and specialty materials.
___________________________________________
The session highlighted how PPG’s IT Department supports business operations through three key teams: Data Analytics,
Global IT Infrastructure, and SAP, each playing an important role in decision-making, system integration, and global connectivity.

Overall, this talk gave me valuable insight into how computing and IT are essential to business performance. 
Based on what we learned, my team and I created a simple poster to summarise the key points from the session.
