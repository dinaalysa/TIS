#PC Assemble
On 12 November 2025, my teammates and I were taught on how to assemble and disassemble PC🪛 while also learning the components of the PC. 
As I have no experience in assembling one, I got the chance to look properly in the inside of the PC 👀.
___________________________________________

We are told to handle the components with care and only touch🤏 certain part of the components, as it is highly sensitive and can be damage if handled it wrongly.
My groups successfully assemble the PC since the computer can be turn on when connected to our PC🖥.

👩‍💻It was an amazing and helpful experience that I can utilize in the future when i got my own table computer🤩🤩.
