# Industry Talk 2

INDUSTRY TALK | PROJECT MANAGEMENT & SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT 💼

I had the opportunity to attend an industry talk by Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib from Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd., which provided valuable insights into system development and project management.
The session highlighted the importance of SDLC, differences between Waterfall and Agile, and how AI can enhance productivity when used responsibly. 

One key takeaway for me was that future computer science professionals need more than coding skills—we also need strong planning, system thinking, and AI awareness.

This talk helped me better understand industry expectations and the skills needed to prepare for future careers in computing.
