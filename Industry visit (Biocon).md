# Industry Visit to Biocon Sdn. Bhd.

On 23 December 2025, for my subject Technology and Information System assignment, I had the opportunity to visit Biocon Sdn. Bhd. in Gelang Patah, Johor.
___________________________________________

 I visited the Drug Product (DP) building where the insulin is produced. 🦠Pichia, a type of yeast, will first undergo fermentation process. 
 Then, the liquid💧 produce will be taken and purified before undergo crystalization process which turns the liquid into powder.
 The powder (drug substance) will be transferred to DP manufacturing. There, the powder will combine with other chemicals to become liquid again, then filled into cartridges.
 After that, it went to visual inspection🔍 to check for any impurities such as dirt or even bubbles🫧. Lastly, the insulin went to DP packaging, which have two department, 
 pen assembly and pen packing where they assemble the cartridge containing insulin into cartridge holder and being labelled before it being packed away then sent out from Biocon📦.

👀I can only watch the machine where they assemble and package the insulin, as the other part is highly restricted to visitor.
Unfortunately, the machine are not running by the time we visit there as it following strict schedule, so we cannot see how the machine works.
But it was amazing how many the machine can produce the final product of insulin which is 100 thousand per shift. 
‼️🚫📷 I cannot provide any picture as it was not allowed when we are inside the premises.
