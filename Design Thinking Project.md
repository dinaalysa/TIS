# Design Thinking Project
## Theme: Digital Solutions for the Autism & ADHD Community
This semester introduced me to design thinking as a human-centered approach to problem solving. Instead of focusing only on solutions, it emphasizes understanding users, staying open to new ideas, and learning through hands-on experimentation.

Working on this project helped me understand how the five stages of design thinking can be applied to develop practical and effective solutions. It also strengthened my skills in teamwork, project coordination, and critical thinking.🧠

Overall, this experience increased my confidence in tackling problems creatively and producing meaningful, user-focused solutions that can be applied in future projects
